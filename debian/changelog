box86 (0.3.6) unstable; urgency=low
* Wrapping: More libs and and function wrapping (gtk3, vulkan...)
* Reworked X11 Callback handling, for better stability
* Reworked exit and the load/unload of libs
* Some more profiles in box86rc
* More SSE3+ opcodes in dynarec
* Better way to rename executable (including wine ones) so driver like mesa can apply the correct profile
* Lots of improvments in x87 handling (virtual stack, rounding, ffree, etc.)
* => should improve games stability
* Better handling of large block in the dynarec
* => should speedup dynarec, and allow use of BIGBLOCK 2 or 3 on more software
* Added suport for BOX86_DYNAREC_CALLRET optimisation.
* => backported from box64, can give 10% or more speed increase (but can also decrease speed in some cases). Still a bit crashy so use with care.

 * => Some work also to reduce the memory footprint

 * Added BOX86_DYNAREC_FORWARD to allow bigger Dynarec block to be build

 * Some fixes to flags handling in the Dynarec on some special cases
 * Added specific suppport for RK3588 board (needed some hack in signal handling, probably due to the use of a non mainlined kernel)

 * Added specific suppport for RK3588 board (needed some hack in signal handling, probably due to the use of a non mainlined kernel)
